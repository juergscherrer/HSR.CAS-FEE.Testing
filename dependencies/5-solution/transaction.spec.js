 * We develop iteratively. So we
 * 1. create the spec
 * 2. check if tests are failing
 * 3. implement the feature
 * 4. check if the tests are passing
 * 5. Do the whole iteration for the next SMALL feature
 *
 * So we can implement, test, version & integrate iterative
 * -> reduces errors, improves quality, creates a clean history.
